# Product Requirements Document: Thai Script Learning PWA

## Introduction/Overview

This PWA (Progressive Web App) is designed to help complete beginners learn Thai script through an interactive, mobile-first learning platform. The application focuses on character recognition, pronunciation, and writing practice with stroke order guidance. Users can learn Thai consonants, vowels, tone marks, and special characters through logically grouped lessons, with flexible testing options that allow customization of character sets.

**Problem Statement:** Complete beginners struggle to learn Thai script due to lack of structured, interactive learning tools that combine visual recognition, audio pronunciation, and writing practice in a mobile-friendly format.

**Goal:** Create an accessible, offline-capable PWA that teaches Thai script fundamentals through progressive lessons, character recognition, pronunciation practice, and writing exercises with comprehensive progress tracking.

## Goals

1. **Primary Goal:** Enable complete beginners to learn Thai script characters through structured, interactive lessons
2. **Learning Goal:** Provide character recognition, pronunciation, and writing practice for all Thai script components
3. **Flexibility Goal:** Allow users to customize their learning path and test content
4. **Accessibility Goal:** Ensure mobile-first design with offline capability
5. **Engagement Goal:** Track progress and provide meaningful feedback through quizzes and tests

## User Stories

- **As a student**, I want to customize my tests to include specific characters so that I can focus on areas where I need more practice
- **As a user**, I want to add more characters to my tests progressively so that I can gradually increase difficulty

### Progress & Assessment Stories
- **As a learner**, I want to take comprehensive tests covering multiple lessons so that I can assess my overall progress
- **As a user**, I want my progress to be saved locally so that I can continue learning without creating an account
- **As a student**, I want visual feedback on my writing attempts so that I can improve my stroke order and character formation
